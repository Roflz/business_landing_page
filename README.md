- **Replace Placeholder Content:**
  - All major sections are in `app/components/` (e.g., `HeroSection.tsx`, `AboutSection.tsx`, etc.).
  - Look for `[Your Business Name]`, `[Feature One]`, `[Service One]`, etc. Replace these with your or your client's real content.
  - Demo/mock data is used for testimonials and portfolio items‚Äîswap these for real client data as needed.

- **Color Theme Switcher:**
  - Use the theme dropdown in the navigation bar to preview Blue, Green, or Dark color schemes.
  - You can add more themes by editing the theme options in `app/layout.tsx` and adding CSS variables in `app/globals.css`.

- **Animations:**
  - All sections use a simple fade-in animation. You can add more or use a library like Framer Motion for advanced effects.

- **Mobile & Responsive:**
  - The template is fully responsive. Test on different devices for best results.
